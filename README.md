# EK-Student

> Assigned engineer: David Guri  
> School: Ernest Koliqi High-School
> Tirana, Albania
> Status: In Progress

## 👀 Overview

My project is an app called EK-Student, which is going to be available on all platforms (such as iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS\*). The app aims to help students of Ernest Koliqi high-school to keep track of their classes, updated schedules, project deadlines, assigned homework, test dates, etc. Furthermore, the app will also provide a "news" section, where all relevant news from the Ministry of Education (such as national holidays, etc) and from the school itself (such as field trip announcements, events, etc) are shown.

The app is divided into sections, also known as Tabs:

### 🏠 Home Tab

The first tab is the **Home tab**, otherwise the "dashboard" of the app, where you can quickly glance at the most important information.

At the top (look at the screenshot below), there are three cards. One for the weather, to help you in the morning to quickly see what the weather is going to be like. Below that there is a Microsoft Teams button that redirects you to the Teams app. To the right of these is a bigger card that holds three different buttons: Goals, Tasks, and Projects.

-   The Goals button leads to a modal where you can set and complete goals for yourself throughout the school year.
-   The Tasks button leads to a modal where you can view deadlines for homework or other assignments. You can also set them as completed when done.
-   The Projects button leads to a modal where you can view different projects throughout your subjects, including your groups, the points the project has, and the objectives.

Below this section, Next Today and For Tomorrow cards are displayed one beneath the other.

-   The Next Today card shows you what classes, projects, and tests you have for the rest of that day, all color-coded to make it easier to distinguish.
-   The For Tomorrow card shows the same things as the Next Today card does, but in a more detailed view in the form of a list.

### 🗓️ Calendar Tab

The second tab is the **Calendar tab**, where you have a calendar view with different colored dots below the days to represent different events (such as days off, project deadlines, and tests).

### 📰 News Tab

The last tab is the **News tab**, which is divided into three sub-sections:

-   The Submit Project card gives you the option to submit one of the projects you have done that might be extra-curricular that you would like the other students to view and give feedback on.
-   The Today in News section gives you all the news published or relevant to the day you are viewing it.
-   At the bottom of the News tab, there is an Older News section, where you can view older news (pretty self-explanatory)

\*→ On the desktop the app will be in the form of a web app on the browser

## 🎯 Goals

With this app, I aim to make student life here in our school easier, even by a small margin. I've seen students wasting time and energy making spreadsheets, and calendars, having to redo them themselves countless times throughout the year, and I think that this app will help them with that.

## ﻿⛳️ Milestones

### ‼️ Getting permission

[ASAP]

First, I need to get permission to use this app in the school from the principal and the administrator. This is highly important.

### 🅰️ Alpha Testing

2023-03-01

The alpha testing is the complete MVP (minimum viable product) version of the app, tested on my own devices using a "dummy" database and users.

### 🅱️ Beta Testing

2023-05-01

Beta testing the complete MVP version of the app with a "dummy" database to select students and teachers who would like to participate.

### 🎓 Rollout to High-School students and teachers

2023-09-11

Since there are fewer students in high school, it is easier to manage and troubleshoot

### 🧑🏻‍🏫 Rollout to Middle-School students and teachers

2024-09-09

The app is finally done and ready to be used in the entire school. 5<sup>th</sup> grade and below are too young to use the app and actually benefit from it.
